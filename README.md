## Studio Definition

Studio is an enterprise-grade, one-stop system workbench that integrates unified identity authentication, fine-grained permission control, large model resource management, and various system-level common services.

It aims to provide developers and administrators with a secure, efficient, and visual control center and workspace—helping enterprises quickly establish a security foundation and manage AI model assets.

## ✨ Core Features

Studio is organized around three core modules:

### 🔐 1. Identity and Authentication

Provides comprehensive identity governance and access control:

- **Unified Identity Authentication**: Supports local account management and multi-source identity integration.
- **RBAC Permission System**: Based on a "User-Role-Permission" model, enabling flexible role management and access policy configuration.
- **Organizational Structure**: Supports multi-level department management and user group segmentation.
- **Log & Audit**: Full-chain recording of operation logs and security audits to ensure compliance.

### 🤖 2. Model

Model resource management and scheduling for the AI era:
* **Prompt Engineering**: Visual prompt creation and testing.
* **Quota Management**: Controls on token usage and call limits for different tenants or applications.
* **Model Management**: Supports integration of large language models (LLMs) and smaller models (e.g., Embedding, Rerank), and sets a global default model.
* **Model Statistics**: Real-time monitoring of model usage data, with visual reports.

### 🛠 3. Common Services

Infrastructure-level basic services:

- **Business Domain Management**: Manage DataAgent, DataFlow, Ontology, and Operator by business domain.
- **Notification**: Email notifications and third-party messaging plugins (e.g., DingTalk, WeCom, etc.).
